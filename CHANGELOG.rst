  Changed stuff in the cliff detection to remove printouts and make it cleaner. I'm merging this since it's a simple one.
* Restoring publishing frequency, I'll try it out later

  Added optional 3d obstacle avoidance to scitos_2d_navigation. We've been running for a week and seems to work. The downsampling of the cloud takes quite a lot of cpu (about 30% of one cpu) but I can't think of any faster way to do it (approximate voxel grid atm, ideas?). This is dependent on merged pull request https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_common/pull/26 since we need good estimate of chest camera height and angle with respect to floor. Also made the costmap update at 3 hz instead of 5 to make sure it would always complete on time. Needs more testing with people around. As mentioned, with previous usage this won't make any difference.
* Changed update rates of costmaps and allowed smaller distances for obstacle adding
* Added a few comments
* Added some improvements that should make the planner work at a better rate
* Forgot to remove launch of clearing wall node
* Removed clearing wall since it shouldn't be needed any more, changed cutoffs to be less generous
* Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/nilsbore/scitos_2d_navigation
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master'
* Fixed bug where I accidentally exchanged clearing and obstacle cloud
* Added brunos change to disallow rotation in move_base_3d
* Merge remote-tracking branch 'upstream/master'
* Merge pull request `#15 <https://github.com/strands-project/scitos_2d_navigation/issues/15>`_ from BFALacerda/master
  disallowing rotate recovery
* Moved to using correct camera frame since Rares fixed his code
* Added possibility to don't add obstacles too close to the camera
* Commented move_base_3d launch file
* Made it possible to change camera topic and changed clear_sensor to use the cloud with removed edges, missed that before
* Commented some source files
* Stupid tabs
* Changed to have two different move_base files for with and without camera, switched by using argument with_camera parameter to scitos_2d_nav
* Ros apparently only handles double params
* Made camera topics and desired cutoff of point cloud configurable in move_base launch file
* Added node for removing edges of cloud
* Using more robust filtering parameters, will be heavy on robot
* Added voxel_grid variant that doesn't add voxel if too few points are in there
* disallowing rotate recovery
* more filters for the subsampling, homework for the weekend
* Added depth camera to obstacle avoidance, node for subsampling the cloud to make the ray tracing feasible

* Update README.md
* Update README.md
* Added move base params and changed package path in nav.launch
* Added a new package scitos_2d_navigation_config for the move base params
